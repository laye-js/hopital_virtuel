# Website Centre Hospitalier de fann

Centre Hospitalier de fann was the notorious site of the Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit in Aotearoa New Zealand. The Unit operated from the 1970s until around 1980 when it was closed as a result of complaints about the use of aversion therapy including Electroconvulsive therapy used as a punishment against the children held in the unit. The Psychiatrist in charge of the unit, Dr Selwyn Leeks, was never held accountable and survivors of Lake Alice still wait for adequate redress.
