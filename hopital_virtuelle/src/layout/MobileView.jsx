              The United Nations Committee Against Torture (UNCAT) found New
              Zealand in breach of the Convention Against Torture in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              New Zealand had failed to ensure a prompt and impartial
              investigation into allegations of systematic physical, emotional
              and sexual child abuse at the Lake Alice Child and Adolescent
              Unit.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Child and Adolescent Unit opened in 1972 and closed around
              1980 after allegations that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and
              paraldehyde 'aversion therapy' were used as a form of torture to
              punish children with behavioural issues in the unit.
            </p>
            <p>
              After civil cases were brought against the Crown, minimal
              compensation was paid to a group of 95 survivors in 2001. Legal
              fees swallowed up the majority of this payment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Three of New Zealand's initial periodic reports to UNCAT
              deliberately excluded all mention of Lake Alice and the survivors’
              allegations of torture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two survivors of Lake Alice have since had their complaints
              recognised by the United Nations – Paul Zentveld in 2020 and
              Malcolm Richards in 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only in 2021 was a former member of staff charged by the police.No
              one has ever been convicted.
            </p>
            <p>New Zealand is still in breach of the convention. </p>
            <p>
              Fifty years on, when will there be justice for the survivors of
              Lake Alice?
