It included many horrific and disturbing revelations. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was used to punish anything from poor school work to running away. Several claimants reported ECT being administered to their genitals. Paraldehyde, administered by painful injection, was also used as a punishment. Children were held naked in solitary confinement with only a mattress and a bucket for the toilet. One 15-year-old boy was locked in a wooden cage with a seriously disturbed adult patient. Many of the children experienced sexual abuse by both staff and adult patients. The report found the majority of children at Lake Alice had behavioural rather than psychiatric issues.',
