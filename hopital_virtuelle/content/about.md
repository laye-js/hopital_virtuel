## About

This website was developed as part of an ongoing project - [The Moral Drift](https://www.frasercrichton.com/the-moral-drift-1) - examining the history of state care in Aotearoa New Zealand. In its first phase, it was exhibited at [Toi Tauranga/Tauranga Art Gallery in October 2021](https://www.artgallery.org.nz/exhibitions/id/1751).

The project was developed by a collective of investigative researchers, [Fraser Crichton](https://www.frasercrichton.com/) — a Te Whanganui-a-Tara-based researcher and documentary photographer, Malcolm Richards — a survivor of abuse in care at the former Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit and, briefly, Lachlan Kermode — a Research Fellow at the international human rights agency [Forensic Architecture](https://forensic-architecture.org/).

In this online phase, Fraser Crichton has worked with Malcolm Richards to share testimony of Malcolm's experiences at Lake Alice and visualise the now demolished Te Wāhanga Tamaiti, Taitamariki o Lake Alice – The Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit site.

## Recognition

Survivors' testimony in full is available on the Abuse in Care Royal Commission of Inquiry website at [public-hearing-lake-alice-child and Adolescent Unit](https://www.abuseincare.org.nz/investigations-and-hearings/abuse-in-state-psychiatric-care/public-hearing-lake-alice-child-and-adolescent-unit/) including [Malcolm's statement](https://www.abuseincare.org.nz/our-progress/library/v/268/statement-of-malcolm-richards-for-lake-alice-child-and-adolescent-unit-hearing).

Survivors and others who gave testimony to the Royal Commission include:

Mr AA, ACORD (Oliver Sutherland and Ross Galbreath), Kevin Banks, Ms CC who gave evidence for her deceased partner, CCHR, Sharyn Collis, Deborah Dickson, Hake Halo, Andrew Jane, Walton James Ngatai-Mathieson, Leoni McInroe, Mr JJ, Ms LL, Donald Ku, Bryon Malcolm Nicol, Tyrone Marks, Fred Rawiri, Malcolm Richards, Charles Symes, Ms Y, Rangi Wickliffe, Paul Zentveld

Many survivors were unable or chose not to give testimony to the Royal Commission. Their experiences are equally worthy of recognition.
